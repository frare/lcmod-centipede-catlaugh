# Centipede Cat Laugh
Plays the cat laughing meme sound when a Snare Flea (Centipede) grabs someone.
<br><br>
I will be adding more stupid audio mods like this one, with the objective of making a complete stupid audio modpack for all vanilla enemies.

## Features
Like the description says, when someone is grabbed by a Snare Flea, the stupid cat laughing meme will play for all that can hear it.
<br><br>
Volume is balanced around other sounds in the game. By default it will be louder when <i>other</i> players are grabbed, making it easier for the crew to hear. Volume is configurable! ðŸ™‚
